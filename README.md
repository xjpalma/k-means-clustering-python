# K-Means Clustering implemented using Python
Test script that performs K-Means clustering of given data set using Python without using frameworks

## Dependencies:
- Python modules: numpy, random
- Python version: +3

Inputs required:
- data_set: Input data set in given format as demonstrated in the code. must be in data directory
- k_value: No of clusters needed
- precision: The precision with which calculations have to be made

## Files
```Clustering.py``` is the KMeans class and can be called with ```from Clustering import KMeans```<br>
```test.py``` is an implementation of the algorithm using the class KMeans
